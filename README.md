# C++ Modules

This repository contains a series of modules designed to guide learners through core concepts in C++ programming, with a focus on object-oriented programming principles, memory management, and advanced features such as operator overloading and polymorphism. Each module is comprised of multiple exercises, gradually introducing new concepts and complexities in C++.

## Modules Overview

### Module 00 - Basics of C++

- **Namespaces and Classes**: Understanding basic structures in C++.
- **Member Functions**: How functions interact within classes.
- **Initialization Lists**: Best practices for initializing class members.
- **Static and Const**: Efficient use of static and constant variables.

### Module 01 - Memory Management and Pointers

- **Memory Allocation**: Effective management of dynamic memory in C++.
- **Pointers to Members and References**: Manipulating member pointers and understanding references.
- **Switch Statements**: Control flow with switch-case.

### Module 02 - Polymorphism, Overloading, and Canonical Forms

- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**: Implementing polymorphic behavior through method overloading.
- **Operator Overloading**: Enabling intuitive operator use for custom classes.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Following best practices for C++ class design with constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.
