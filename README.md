# C++ Modules

This repository contains a series of modules designed to guide learners through core concepts in C++ programming, with a focus on object-oriented programming principles, memory management, and advanced features such as operator overloading and polymorphism. Each module is comprised of multiple exercises, gradually introducing new concepts and complexities in C++.

## Modules Overview

### Module 00 - Basics of C++

- **Namespaces and Classes**: Understanding basic structures in C++.
- **Member Functions**: How functions interact within classes.
- **Initialization Lists**: Best practices for initializing class members.
- **Static and Const**: Efficient use of static and constant variables.

### Module 01 - Memory Management and Pointers

- **Memory Allocation**: Effective management of dynamic memory in C++.
- **Pointers to Members and References**: Manipulating member pointers and understanding references.
- **Switch Statements**: Control flow with switch-case.

### Module 02 - Polymorphism, Overloading, and Canonical Forms

- **Ad-hoc Polymorphism**: Implementing polymorphic behavior through method overloading.
- **Operator Overloading**: Enabling intuitive operator use for custom classes.
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: Following best practices for C++ class design with constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.

### Module 03 - Inheritance

- **Base and Derived Classes**: Understanding the relationship between parent and child classes.
    Construction/Destruction Chaining: Properly managing constructor and destructor calls in inheritance.
- **Special Member Functions**: Enhancing functionality with additional member functions.
- **Deep Copy Implementation**: Ensuring memory safety by avoiding shallow copies.

### Module 04 - Subtype Polymorphism and Abstract Classes

- **Abstract Classes**: Designing non-instantiable base classes with pure virtual functions.
- **Subtype Polymorphism**: Leveraging polymorphism for dynamic class behavior.
- **Memory Management**: Proper handling of memory allocation and preventing leaks with virtual destructors.
